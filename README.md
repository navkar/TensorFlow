## Association Rule Mining
* Association rule mining is primarily focused on finding frequent co-occurring associations among a collection of items.


## Metrics to form Association rules (support and confidence)

### Support 
* Support is the number of times you see an item or items over a list of all the transactions.
* support = (no of items the item was bought / total no of transactions) * 100

#### Representing Support
The support of A -> B is the percentage of transactions that contain both A and B.

1. A could be Mobile Chargers
1. B could be Adapters

* Support of A -> B = Number of Transactions that have both A and B / Total Number of Transactions
* Support of two items A and B is represented as

```
support(A->B) = P(AUB)
```
