# Tensor flow concepts

### What is a tensor?

* Its the unit of data in a network. 
* A tensor is a multidimensional array of numbers.

### What does a tensor comprise of?

A tensor has a **Rank**, **Shape** and a **Type**

* Rank - Specifies the number of dimensions of the tensor
* Shape - Number of rows and columns in a tensor
* Type - Datatype that is carried by the tensor.

### What is TensorFlow? 

* TensorFlow is called TensorFlow because it handles the flow (node/mathematical operation) of tensors (data). We define a computational graph with Tensors and mathematical operations (node) to create system for machine learning and deep learning.

* A computational graph where edges carry data as N-dimensional vector known as tensor and nodes represent mathematical operation which acts on the tensors.

### What is a computational graph? 

* A computation graph is a representation of data flow while performing calculations using TensorFlow.
* This graph organizes the computations and calculates them sequentially.

### What are the various tensor ranks?

* Rank 0 - Scalar (An element of a field that has magnitude but no direction)
* Rank 1 - Vector (entity in space with magnitude and direction)
* Rank 2 - Matrix (2D array)

### What are various type of variables in Tensor Flow?

* **Constants** (immutable variable and can't be modified)

```
x = tf.constant(42, name="a", dtype=tf.float32)
```

```
#Constant example
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(4,)
v = tf.constant(2,)
b = tf.multiply(a, v)

sess = tf.Session()
model = tf.global_variables_initializer()

sess.run(model)

print(sess.run(b))
```

* **Variables** (In-memory buffers that have tensors. These tensors require initialization to be consumed in the data flow graph.)

```
# Set model weights
W = tf.Variable(rng.randn(), name="weight")
b = tf.Variable(rng.randn(), name="bias")
a = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([5]), name="a")
z = tf.Variable(tf.add(x, y), trainable=False)
```
* **Placeholders** (Initially unassigned but get initialized when the session is invoked)

These are special type of variable in TensorFlow which is used in runtime to pass values to Tensors.
The main use of placeholders is they allow the creation of operations and the computational graph sans needing to provide the data before that.
The required data can be added during the actual runtime from any external sources.

```
#Placeholder example
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[1])
v = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[1])
b = tf.multiply(a, v)

sess = tf.Session()
model = tf.global_variables_initializer()

sess.run(model)

print(sess.run(b,feed_dict={a: (4,), v:(5,)}))
```

### How to convert NumPy array can be converted to a tensor 

```
import tensorflow as tf 
tensor1d = tf.convert_to_tensor(tensor_1d, dtype=tf.int64)
# Creating a 2D Tensor
array_2d_1 = np.array(np.arange(16).reshape(4,4), dtype='int32')
```

### What are the attributes of an Array?

* ndim - dimensions
* shape - rows and columns
* dtype - datatype
